## Paid visits

Paid visits will be booked into your calendar by the client at the time you agree on. This allows us to make sure you get paid, are insured and are safe.

Remember to accept them, or else you wont get paid. The visit contains the location of the appointment, so it is important to look at it to know where you are going.

Once the visit is over, remember to leave a short repot, which you can do through the platform by:
 - Selecting the visit in the visits tab or in your calendar.
 - Hitting the "Write report" button
 - Enter a quick summary and hit submit.

The client always appreciates a nice report, as it lets them know what you have done.

If you have any questions, email us on admin@primecarers.co.uk or give us a call on 02033693624
