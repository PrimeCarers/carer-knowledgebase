## Patient details and medications

From the patients details section, you can select the patient you are seeing and see what the client has written about them (or themselves).

From the medications section, you can see what medications they are on and what they are expected to take and when. This should help you to understand any of the risks you might face when caring for the patient as well as what you might be expected to remind them to take and at what time.
