## Managing visits with your calendar

Your calendar shows you where you are expected to be when. From it you can see what visits are occurring, what time they are booked in for and what you are being asked to do. By clicking into a visit in the future, you can see what is planned and how much you will be paid. By clicking a visit in the past you can see your client's feedback.

If you have any questions, email us on admin@primecarers.co.uk or give us a call on 02033693624
