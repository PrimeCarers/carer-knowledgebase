## How payments work on PrimeCarers

Payment is taken from the client 24-48hrs after the end of the visit. This is designed to give you and them time to prevent the payment from occurring, for any valid reason confirmed by you and them, by getting in-touch with the team. This is then cleared into your bank account 5-7 working days later.

## How do you get paid?
When you signed up, you created a Stripe account for yourself. The payment is transferred into that 24-48hs after the end of the visit. This means that the money is in your hands, under your control. No one ca take it away from you at that point. Stripe then does its own credit and fraud checks, and then transfers it into your account 5-7 working days later.

We have chosen Stripe as our secure, encrypted, PCI compliant and easy to use payment solution. All payments are handled through Stripe on the PrimeCarers platform and can be made using a Debit or Credit Card. Stripe will process your personal financial data through their secure and encrypted service. PrimeCarers does not see this sensitive data. Payment goes directly to the carers, minus PrimeCarers commission.

## What is Stripe?
Stripe is the secure payment platform that we use to handle payments on PrimeCarers. They are used by over 10,000 companies including Oxfam, British Heart Foundation and Unicef so you can be sure that your details are in safe hands. You can learn more at Stripe. Stripe requires your card details to be entered when booking your first visit but your first visit is still free and only an introductory visit.

## Why do we take payment details before the intro visit?
We ask for your payment details before the client books the free introductory visit but they are not charged â€“ this is simply so we have a validated reference of who requested the visit and is an important for your safety as a carer, as part of our safeguarding policy.
