## What to do on an introductory visit

Introductory visits are interviews. However it is not just for the client to interview you, but for you to understand whether you can and want to work with the family. Use it to showcase your skills and knowledge, understand what will be needed from you and get to know the patient and anyone else there.

Once you have agreed to a time for the introductory visit, ask the client to book it through the platform, we will collect payment details for your protection and to make sure that they will be able to pay you.

Once the have booked it through the platform, remember to accept it. The visit contains the location of the appointment, so it is important to look at it to know where you are going.

On an intro visit you should:
 - Arrive on time
 - Get to know the client
 - Get to know the family
 - Get to know the environment
 - Agree on what you will be doing when there
 - Agree on future visits
 - Run a risk assessment

 Introductory visits almost always result in further paid visits, so don't be nervous, just put your best foot forward.
