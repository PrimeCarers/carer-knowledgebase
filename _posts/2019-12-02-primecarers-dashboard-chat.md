## How to chat with clients

Chatting you clients is the first thing you will want do on the platform, to get to know them, and understand whether or not you will be able to work with them.
When you first get in touch:
 - Find out what care they need
 - Find out what times the care is needed (remember to ask whether any times are flexible)
 - Make sure that you are comfortable with what has been described

 Arrange an introductory visit
 - Suggest a couple of times for you to meet the client and the patient, in the place where the care will be delivered
 - Agree on a time and date
 - Ask them to book an intro visit
